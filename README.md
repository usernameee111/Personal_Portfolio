# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **first practical project in Front-End Development** — a portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and learning journey.

## 📌 Why I Built This

Having a portfolio is essential in tech — it’s not just a CV, but a living showcase of growth.
I wanted to create everything from scratch instead of using a ready-made template, so I can always improve, expand, and customize it to reflect who I am.
